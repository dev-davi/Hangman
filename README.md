## A basic **Python** project for a hangman game.

The basic rules of the game is as follows:

- The player has to guess the correct word that the host (in this case the system prompt) has in mind.
- blanks are provided that specifies the number of letters in the desired word.
- The player is allowed to guess one letter at a time.
- If the player guesses a letter **not present** in the word, a stroke is drawn.
- If the player guesses a correct letter, it is filled in the blank at it's position.
- The player wins if they are able to guess all letters of the word _before_ the hangman is drawn completely.

## Simply run the python script and you should be able to play it in the terminal.##
